title: Detection of Reconnaissance Activity in NetFlow/Traffic Logs
id: 1
description: |
  Detects potential reconnaissance activity by monitoring unusual traffic patterns,
  such as spikes in connection attempts from a single IP to multiple destinations,
  high traffic volume from a specific IP, and connection attempts to non-standard ports.
  These behaviors are typically associated with scanning or probing activities during
  the reconnaissance stage.

title: Command and Control Traffic Detection Based on Netflow/Traffic Logs
id: 2
description: |
  Detects anomalous traffic patterns indicating potential Command and Control (C2) activity, 
  such as large volumes of encrypted traffic to external IPs and connections to IPs associated 
  with known C2 infrastructure. These connections often use obfuscation techniques or non-standard 
  ports to bypass detection.

title: Detection of Abnormally Large Outbound Traffic Volumes

  Detects potential data exfiltration attempts by monitoring for abnormally large outbound
  traffic volumes from internal hosts to external IP addresses. Unusually high data transfer
  could indicate attempts to exfiltrate sensitive data outside the organization.

  Detects potential data exfiltration attempts by monitoring for unusually large outbound
